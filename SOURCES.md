# Historical Sources for Grain Market Scams Article

## Counterfeit Coins (Financial Column)

### Primary Sources:
1. **Law of Nicophon (375/74 BCE)** - Athenian law establishing official coin testers (dokimastes) to examine coins for authenticity. This demonstrates that counterfeit coinage was a recognized problem requiring legal intervention.

2. **Peloponnesian War Period (432-404 BCE)** - Historical evidence shows Athens issued debased coinage (plated coins with base metal cores) during financial strain, leading to inflation and economic disruption.

### Secondary Sources:
- Numismatics.org - "The Matter of Inflation" exhibit on ancient Athenian coinage

## Note on Fictional Elements:

The specific scam descriptions (watered grain, mixed quality bait, etc.) are plausible based on:
- Universal patterns of market fraud across history
- Archaeological evidence of standard measures and weights
- Historical references to market regulations and oversight
- Economic principles that would have applied in ancient markets

However, these specific scam types are not directly documented in surviving sources. You may want to:
1. Frame them as "common types of fraud that would have occurred" based on market conditions
2. Add a disclaimer that specific examples are illustrative
3. Focus more heavily on the well-documented counterfeit coin issue
4. Emphasize the historical evidence for market regulations (which implies fraud was occurring)
